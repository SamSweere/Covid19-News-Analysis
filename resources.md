http://nlp.town/blog/off-the-shelf-sentiment-analysis/


# Libraries
word2vec
NLTK
sklearn, dask pipelines: https://medium.com/@chrisfotache/text-classification-in-python-pipelines-nlp-nltk-tf-idf-xgboost-and-more-b83451a327e0


# Preprocessing
1) Tokenization
2) Part-of-speech tagging
3) Syntacitic parsing
    - constituency grammars
    - dependency grammars (often more practical)
4) Lemmatization & Stemming
5) Stopword removal
5) Vectorization
    https://monkeylearn.com/blog/beginners-guide-text-vectorization/
    - Bag of words (pre-deep learning era)
      counts, n-grams, tf-idf scores
    - word2vec (Looks best) https://p.migdal.pl/2017/01/06/king-man-woman-queen-why.html
    - Skitp thought vectors; sentence vectorization; https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06726
